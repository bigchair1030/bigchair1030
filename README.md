- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bigchair1030
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in homelab, automation, redundancy, and network organization/optimization. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker and OPNSense. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love basketball and American football (NBA, NFL, college football, college basketball).
One of the projects I want to tackle in the future is building my own stats database for these leagues and generating a predictive model from it.
